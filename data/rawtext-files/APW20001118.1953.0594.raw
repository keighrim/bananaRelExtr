Callers Admonish Ventura
ST. PAUL [AP ] - Gov. Jesse Ventura 's weekly radio show has been flooded with calls about his new part-time job as a football commentator .
``You belong to the people , 100 percent , 24-hours-a-day , seven days a week ,'' one caller admonished Friday .
Others said his association with the XFL - a rough-and-tumble league organized by NBC and the World Wrestling Federation - degraded his office .
Ventura brushed aside the criticism , saying he would stop if the XFL becomes too raunchy or he deems it in ``any way unacceptable to my position as governor .''
Meanwhile , Democratic state Sen. Ellen Anderson said she would introduce a bill to make the job of governor a part-time position , similar to state lawmaker positions .
``It would fit in [Ventura 's ] political philosophy and it would take away the criticism of him taking outside jobs ,'' she said .
In a contract announced Thursday , the former wrestler agreed to work 10 Saturday night games starting in February .
He can miss them if state business demands it .
