Sandra-Bullock
Bullock Uninjured in Plane Mishap
JACKSON , Wyo. [AP ] - A plane carrying actress Sandra Bullock and three other people missed a runway and crashed at the Jackson Hole Airport early Wednesday .
Authorities said no one was hurt .
Bullock , who stars in the current ``Miss Congeniality ,'' was aboard the plane with two crew members and another person , airport manager George Larson said .
He said all were uninjured .
The twin-engine Hawker corporate jet , owned by RR Investments of Texas , was heavily damaged .
The main nose landing gear was sheared off and both wings were extensively damaged , Larson said .
The plane landed between a runway and taxiway at the airport in northwestern Wyoming about 1:30 a.m .
Blizzard conditions and a high cross wind made landing more difficult than usual , authorities said .
The harsh weather may have disoriented the pilot , Richard Campbell , of <GPE id="e12-20 " type="NAM">Fort Worth , Texas < causing him to mistake a set of ground lights for the center of the runway , airport officials said .
The four climbed out of the wreckage and found the airport was empty .
``So they walked in here and found a custodian , and she called some other people who called the sheriff 's department ,'' Larson said .
A similar accident occurred last winter when a private airplane landed in the same spot .
Larson said the airport plans to install new runway lights .
