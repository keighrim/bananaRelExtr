Booking Your Ticket :
- Fly nonstop .
The fewer connections you make , the lower the chance that you will suffer a delay .
- Pick airports with care .
If you have to connect , choose the least-congested airport possible ; some airports , like Chicago O'Hare and La Guardia in New York , experience chronic delays .
Take into consideration the weather and the season ; an airport in the South might have fewer winter snowstorms but more spring and summer thunderstorms .
- Check times between connecting flights .
Airlines often book tight connections and do not take responsibility if you miss yours .
Assume each leg of your flight will arrive late , and book connections that allow ample time .
- Check on-time records .
The Transportation Department requires major domestic airlines to make the on-time record for every flight available to consumers .
You can check online at www.dot.gov .
That site also reports each airline 's on-time record for the previous month .
- Travel on off-peak days and at off-peak times .
Saturday is usually the least-traveled day of the week ; so are major holidays .
Monday mornings and Friday afternoons are peak travel times for business travelers .
Flights leaving earlier in the day are less likely to be delayed , because of the cascading effect that disruptions have on airline schedules .
- Use smaller airports .
Instead of Los Angeles International , for example , consider flying into Burbank or John Wayne Airport in Orange County , Calif ., or use Westchester County Airport instead of JFK in New York .
- Avoid electronic tickets .
Though they are convenient and more secure than an easily lost paper ticket , they are not transferable between most airlines if you need to switch carriers because of delays .
- Watch for labor disruptions .
Check newspapers and Web sites like www.thenewfoundlandgroup.com to identify airlines experiencing labor strife , which often increases cancellations and delays .
- Leave a number .
Make sure the airline you book with has a phone number at which you can be notified of delays or cancellations .
- Use a travel agent .
A good one can be a great ally in the event of a problem - and may save you time and money .
Day of Departure :
- Be informed .
Check your flight 's status before heading to the airport .
Automated telephone services or airline Web sites often provide more up-to-date information than do ticket agents .
The Federal Aviation Administration 's Web site , www.fly.faa.gov , has real-time information on operations at the biggest airports .
- Pack defensively .
Take along a change of clothes and a toothbrush in your carry-on bag .
If traveling with an infant , take 24 hours ' worth of diapers and extra formula .
When possible , avoid checking luggage , in case you need to switch flights or carriers .
Ship your gifts ahead .
- Educate yourself .
Find out what your airline promises to do for passengers in the event of a delay .
Print out a copy of the policy from the airline 's Web site , and carry it with you - in case the airline representatives need a reminder .
If a Flight Is Delayed :
- Keep your cool .
Becoming angry at airline personnel is counterproductive .
Sympathy for their plight will sometimes produce results .
- Don't stand in line .
To get on another flight , it is often more effective to call the airline from the airport than to wait at the ticket counter .
Carry a cell phone ; if delays are widespread , public telephones may be in demand .
- Check the competition .
If another airline has seats to your destination , ask your airline to endorse your ticket to the other line .
- Get what you paid for .
If you paid full fare or are a high-mileage frequent flier , let the airline know .
Your odds of getting a seat on the next flight out will increase , or the airline might pay for your hotel , if you are delayed overnight .
- Consider driving .
If the last leg of your flight is a 200-mile hop , renting a car might be a better choice than waiting out a delay .
Getting Even :
- Write a letter .
The airlines have pledged to respond to consumer complaints within 60 days .
They almost always offer a refund , reimbursement of expenses , a discount on your next ticket - or all three .
Be sure to save the relevant paperwork .
- Make it a federal case .
Send a copy of your letter to Washington .
Complaints are charged against each airline in the Transportation Department 's monthly Air Travel Consumer Report and serve as a basis for rule making and enforcement action .
