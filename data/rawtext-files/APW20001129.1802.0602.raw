Copley-Sale
Sale of Copley Newspaper Delayed
CHICAGO [AP ] - A federal judge has issued a temporary restraining order against Copley Press Inc. blocking the sale of The News Sun in Waukegan to Hollinger International .
The judge 's ruling was prompted by a lawsuit filed last week by the union representing editorial workers at the paper , which claims the sale would not require Hollinger to honor a collective-bargaining agreement reached between the paper and employees .
Lawyers for the Chicago Newspaper Guild say language in the agreement is ``not satisfactory .''
U.S. District Judge Blanche Manning on Tuesday barred the sale of the paper for at least 10 days , giving Copley time to reword the agreement .
``If the sale were allowed to proceed , the union would be without a legal remedy and would suffer the irreparable harm of having the [agreement ] being rendered a nullity ,'' Manning wrote .
After the hearing , lawyers for Copley would not say if they would appeal Manning 's restraining order .
Calls to Douglas A. Darch , an attorney for Copley , were not immediately returned on Wednesday .
The guild has filed a grievance to have the matter arbitrated with Copley before the sale is completed .
Hollinger International , owner of the Chicago Sun-Times and the Daily Southtown in Tinley Park , is attempting to acquire The News Sun and other northern Illinois Copley newspapers , including The Courier News in Elgin , The Beacon News in Aurora and The Herald News in Joliet .
Although the ruling did not mention the other Copley Press papers , it is expected that The News Sun issue will have be resolved before the sale of the entire group is finalized .
