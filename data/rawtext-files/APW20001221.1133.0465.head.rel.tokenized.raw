Economic Growth Slows Sharply
WASHINGTON [AP ] - The U.S. economy slowed sharply to an annual growth rate of just 2.2 percent in the summer , the weakest performance in four years , the government said Thursday .
The report provides further evidence that America 's boom times are definitely over .
The Commerce Department said the third quarter increase in the gross domestic product - the economy 's total output of goods and services - was even weaker than previously believed as the trade deficit deteriorated further .
A month ago , third quarter GDP was estimated to have risen by 2.4 percent .
The July-September performance marked a dramatic slowdown from a sizzling 5.6 percent GDP growth rate in the April-June quarter .
The sharp falloff in economic growth in the summer and mounting evidence of more recent weakness , including disappointing Christmas sales , have increased worries about whether America 's record 10-year economic expansion was in danger of toppling into a recession .
